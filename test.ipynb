Her music made people hail her as the \"voice of the voiceless ones\". She was often called \"the conscience of Latin America\".\\nCantora, un Viaje Íntimo  (English: Cantora, An Intimate Journey) is a double album by Argentine singer Mercedes Sosa, released on 2009 through Sony Music Argentina. The album features Cantora 1 and Cantora 2, the project is Sosa\\'s final album before her death on October 4, 2009.\\nAt the 10th Annual Latin Grammy Awards, Cantora 1 was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Folk Album and Best Recording Package, the latter award went to Alejandro Ros, the art director of the album. Additionally, Sosa won two out of five nominations for the albums at the Gardel Awards 2010, the double album was nominated for Album of the Year and Production of the Year and won Best DVD while both Cantora 1 and Cantora 2 were nominated for Best Female Folk Album, with the former winning the category.\\npublic. Sosa and her first husband, Manuel Oscar Matus, with whom she had one son, were key players in the mid-60s nueva canción movement (which was called nuevo cancionero in Argentina). Her second record was Canciones con Fundamento, a collection of Argentine folk songs.\\n== Background ==\\nThe albums were produced by Popi Spatocco, frequent collaborator of Sosa, engineered by Jorge \"Portugués\" Da Silva and recorded from May 2008 to June 2009 at Estudios Panda and Estudios Ion, both in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the first session took place at Estudios Panda while the rest of the album was recorded at Estudios Ion, the first songs to be recorded were \"Agua, Fuego, Tierra y Viento\" with Argentine singer Soledad Pastorutti and \"Misionera\" with Brazilian accordionist Luiz Carlos Borges, the recording of the album was marked by interruptions due to the delicate health condition of Sosa, she would eventually die on October 16, 2009 at age 74, a couple of months following the release of the albums, about Cantora, Spatocco said that \"it was like receiving a diploma of honor, she was dedicated to whatever happened because she knew that I had her back\".\\nSosa \"spent the late 1960s building her audience in Europe and among the cosmopolitan middle class in Buenos Aires, becoming in the process a much bigger star\" than her contemporaries. In 1967, Sosa toured the United States and Europe with great success. In later years, she performed and recorded extensively, broadening her repertoire to include material from throughout Latin America.\\nSosa was born on 9 July 1935, in San Miguel de Tucumán, in the northwestern Argentine province of Tucumán, of mestizo ancestry. She was of French, Spanish and Diaguita descent. Her nickname \"la negra\", which is a common nickname in Argentina for people with darker complexion, is a reference to her indigenous heritage. Her parents, a day laborer and a washerwoman, were Peronists, although they never registered in the party, and she started her career as a singer for the Peronist Party in Tucuman under the name Gladys Osorio. In 1950, at age fifteen, she won a singing competition organized by a local radio station and was given a contract to perform for two months. She recorded her first album, La Voz de la Zafra, in 1959. A performance at the 1965 Cosquín National Folklore Festival—where she was introduced and brought to the stage while sitting in the audience by fellow folk singer Jorge Cafrune— brought her to the attention of the Argentine public.
